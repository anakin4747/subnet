As a hiring manager for an embedded software engineering position, here's my critique of the provided README.md file:

1. Lack of Introduction: The README.md should start with a concise introduction that provides an overview of the project. 
It should briefly explain what the project does, its purpose, and its significance in the context of subnetting concepts.

2. Project Description: While you mention that the project is a command-line tool for calculating subnets, it would be 
helpful to include a brief explanation of how the tool works and what specific subnetting calculations it can perform. 
This would give potential users a clearer understanding of the project's capabilities.

3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C: While it's commendable that you've attempted to implement OOP concepts in C,
it would be beneficial to provide a brief explanation of how you achieved this in the project. Mentioning the specific
OOP practices or design patterns you used, along with their benefits, would help demonstrate your understanding of software
engineering principles.

4. Installation Instructions: The README.md should provide clear and concise instructions on how to install and run the
project. While you mention a make target for installation, it would be helpful to include step-by-step instructions,
including any prerequisites or dependencies that need to be satisfied.

5. Future Plans: It's great that you have outlined some future plans for the project. However, instead of just listing them,
provide a brief explanation of each planned feature or improvement. This will showcase your ability to think ahead and your
commitment to continuously enhancing the project.

6. Testing: The section on testing is informative, but it could be more organized and easier to understand. Consider
providing a brief explanation of the testing approach you have adopted and the importance of thorough testing in a project
like this. Additionally, it would be helpful to include information on how to run the tests and interpret the results.

7. Input Possibilities: The section describing the different input cases is well-documented, providing clear examples and
explanations. However, consider reformatting the examples to improve readability. You could use code blocks or tables to
present the examples in a structured manner.

8. Examples: The examples provided are useful in showcasing the expected output of the program. Consider organizing the
examples in a consistent format, such as using code blocks, and provide a brief explanation of what each example demonstrates.

9. Documentation: While the README.md contains information on how to use the program, it would be beneficial to provide
additional documentation on the internal workings of the code. This could include explanations of the major functions,
data structures used, and any design decisions made.

10. Overall Structure and Formatting: The README.md could benefit from better organization and formatting. Consider using
headings, subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks to improve the structure and readability of the document. This will
make it easier for potential users and contributors to navigate and understand the information provided.

Remember that the README.md serves as the primary source of information for potential users and contributors of the project.
It should provide a clear understanding of the project's purpose, how to use it, and any relevant details needed to contribute
or extend the project.
